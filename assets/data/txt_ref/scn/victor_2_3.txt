At the established spot in the clearing the team comes across a lone burly man. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_0_1
Ar - This guy looks familiar. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_0_2
Ro - This is Viktor. We've seen him in Aeros. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_1
I(shock) - Ah, it's the man who was talking to the father at that time. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_2
V - You shouldn't have come, I only need the mongrel one.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_3
V - But I guess you saved me time from killing you later.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_4
V - Dimitrius will be happy I had to do his dirty work. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_5
Em - Why? What do you want from me? & EV_VICTOR_2_3_6
V - Nothing, you just seem to have something I need. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_7
V - Damn you look weak. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_8
Em - Eh? I don't understand.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_9
V - You don't? Haven't you been visiting the dragon lately? & EV_VICTOR_2_3_10
Em - Uncle Qothus?.. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_11
V - That's its name?  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_12
V - Sorry, I don't take note how my prey was called.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_13
Em - What?.. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_14
Em - You have... & EV_VICTOR_2_3_15
V - Yeah, I've slayed it.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_16
Em(sad) - ... & EV_VICTOR_2_3_17
Em(sad) - Why? & EV_VICTOR_2_3_18
V - *Sigh* Why do men hunt?  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_19
V - To dominate. To feed. To feel joy. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_20
V - And also to test himself.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_21
Em - You killed Uncle Qothus! & EV_VICTOR_2_3_22
Ro - Calm down, Ember! & EV_VICTOR_2_3_23
V - Yeah, save yourself some energy for the fight. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_24
Ar(neutral) - So you test yourself by challenging some girl who looks weak and killing senior dragons? & EV_VICTOR_2_3_25
V - Hmph. You have a sharp tongue, boy. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_26
V - But you are right, it's not much of a test. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_27
Ar(neutral) - So what's your deal? & EV_VICTOR_2_3_28
V - Do you know about dragon souls?  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_29
Ar(neutral) - More or less. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_30
V - I've been collecting them for long years. It seems one was hiding by your side. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_31
Ar(neutral) - And I presume you'd get something by getting them all.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_32
V - Strength. Immortality. Power. You name it.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_33
V - A reward worthy of a supreme warrior. & EV_VICTOR_2_3_34
V - And I'm finally gonna be done with this.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_35
V - Don't let it bother you, you'll die now anyway.  & EV_VICTOR_2_3_36
Ar(anger) - I was an idiot thinking we could talk this out... & EV_VICTOR_2_3_37
