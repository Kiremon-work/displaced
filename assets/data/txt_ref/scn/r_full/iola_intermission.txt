Io - Hey!
Io - I brought you some food from the cult as a thank you for your help
Ro - You didn't have to. 
Ar - Nah, thank you too. I'm tired of only eating dried meat and roots all day.
Iola leaves a basket filled with fruit and berries and goes away.
=SPRITE rose=
Ro - I have never seen berries like this back at home.
Ar - What are you talking about?
Ro - I mean, have you considered that food from here might be poisonous to us?
As Rose looked at Arron he had his face stuffed with berries from the basket.
Ar - I dunno, they taste good.
Ro(shock) - Gosh, Master!
Ar(neutral) - We were fine before now so it will probably be okay. 
Ar - Are gonna try it or I eat it all?
Ro - ......
Ro - They aren't bad.
=SPRITE erika=
Er - Hey, that's some generous gift Iola brought us.
Ar - It's not poisonous, is it?
Er - No, we have these grew in the forests, completely safe, as long as you cook them. But I see you like them raw.
Ar - ...Oh. 
Ro(sad) - I... Don't feel so good...
Er - They can cause diarrhea. 
Ar - I guess that's enough for me for today then.
Rose dashes out of the room and was not seen for a few hours.
