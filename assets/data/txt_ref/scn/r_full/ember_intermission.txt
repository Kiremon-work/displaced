Ro - This seems much bigger on the inside.
Ar - It's really hot in here though. 
Ro - It's natural for a forge.
Em - Is it? It feels normal to me.
Ro - Well, that's because you are a dragon.
Ar - What's with the big wheels on the sides?
Em - It helps me carry it around.
Ro(shock) - You carry around your own forge all by yourself? 
Em - And there's Mister Bitey on the table.
Ar - You certainly are strong to perform something like this.
Em - Thank you! I haven't made this into a cart on my own though.
Em - It's not really heavy to me.
Ro - I don't think I ever seen anyone being able to drag whole building on their own.
Ar - Now that you mention it...
Ar - I never rode a forge in my life. How fast can you go while carrying it?
Em - Oh, I can run!
Ro(sarcasm) - I beg you to reconsider.
