Ar - It's really hot today, isn't it?
Ro - It's hot every day around here. We shouldn't have chosen such a hot location to settle.
Ar(neutral) - Why didn't you say so sooner?
Er - I don't think it's that bad. Barely warmer than in forests.
Ro - That's because of the way you dress.
Er - Might be. Why don't you try it too, Rose? I'm sure you'd look great.
Ar(neutral) - No way, there's too many horny green man around here.
Ro - For a time you are being sensible, but... 
Er - .....
Er - To tell the truth, I also help myself to cool down with some ice magic. 
Ro - Really? I'm envious. 
Er - Oh, let me show you.

Erika moves closer to Rose and puts her hands on her back.
Ro - Ooh, that does feel nice and cool. 
Er(happy) - See? 
Ar - That's convenient.
Ro - Yeah... this is...
Rose has dashed away from Erika's caress.
Ro - ..! Where are you touching me?
Er(happy) - Sorry, my hand has slipped.
Ar - Damn, I should've studied magic to have useful tricks like this.
Ro(sarcasm) - Ugh, I can't believe you.
