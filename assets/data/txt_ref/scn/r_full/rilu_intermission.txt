Rose, Erika and Rilu went to the town doing shopping.
Ro - Wow, look at that dress, it looks so pretty.
Er - We've already stocked on the spare clothes.
Ro - Yeah... Except for Rilu.
=SPRITE rilu=
Ri - Clothes?
Er - Yeah, you wear some bad rags you know. And what's up with the bandages?
Ro - We could get you something better.
Ri - There's no need. And the bandages are useful for patching wounds. I clean them up afterwards.
Ro(shock) - Huh?
Ri - If I get new clothes they'll be tattered rather quickly just like these.
Ro - That's weird. I'd imagine being immortal would make you wear much better clothes and get less damage...
Ri - No, it's the opposite. When you are immortal you get damaged more often because of it. 
Ri - Maybe I'm also not treating my wellbeing as important which leads to being under fire even more often. 
Ri - It's a pain to maintain your clothes in a good state like this.
Er - Why not going around naked then? 
Ri - .....
Ri - I actually never thought about that.
Ro(sarcastic) - No, you can't, you absolutely can't do that.
Er - Silly social rules. 
Er - But it's a thing you should wanna do on your own. Nudity is great.
Ro - Whatever, let's go back before too many people hear us.
