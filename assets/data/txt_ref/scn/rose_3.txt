Rose has persuaded Arron to go to the city on the presumption of a major festival event going there.
Ar(neutral) - This is one of the saddest festivals I've ever seen. & EV_ROSE_3_0
Ro - It's not that bad. & EV_ROSE_3_1
Ar(neutral) - You've dragged me all the way here, for this. & EV_ROSE_3_2
Ro - But you should make yourself more accustomed with the local lifestyle. & EV_ROSE_3_3
Ar(neutral) - Boring. & EV_ROSE_3_4
Ro(talk) - Especially since you are a political figure. & EV_ROSE_3_5
Ar(neutral) - You shouldn't so uptight and allow yourself to relax. & EV_ROSE_3_6
Ro - Well, I thought it would be more lively... & EV_ROSE_3_7
Str - Hey, Sir, wanna cupcake for your lady? & EV_ROSE_3_8
Ro - How much is it? & EV_ROSE_3_9
Str - 50 gold. & EV_ROSE_3_10
Ar(shock) - What the hell? It's 8 times more than usual! & EV_ROSE_3_11
Ro - And it looks kinda stale.  & EV_ROSE_3_12
Str - No way, it's only a week old. & EV_ROSE_3_13
Ar(neutral) - Are you trying to scam us? & EV_ROSE_3_14
Str - Don't want - don't buy. We have enough guests coming in this time of year. & EV_ROSE_3_15
Ar - You can't be serious... & EV_ROSE_3_16
Ro - Master, look. & EV_ROSE_3_17
Rose pointed at the small platform which seemed to be drawing the majority of people‘s attention. & EV_ROSE_3_18
Ar - What's that, a performance? & EV_ROSE_3_19
Ro - Seems so. & EV_ROSE_3_20
Entr - Today, according to our yearly customs, you'll see the beloved story of the Growing Fern. & EV_ROSE_3_21
Entr - A symbol of our land. & EV_ROSE_3_22
Ar(neutral) - A literal weed. & EV_ROSE_3_23
Str2 - Pfft, stupid foreigners never recognize the high culture. & EV_ROSE_3_24
Entr - But before that, we have a special announcement. & EV_ROSE_3_25
Entr - City council declares new orders on taxes and regulations as follows... & EV_ROSE_3_26
Ar(neutral) - That's it, I'm out. & EV_ROSE_3_27
Ro(shock) - Wait, Master, it's not polite to leave! & EV_ROSE_3_28
Ar(shock) - It's not sane to stay! & EV_ROSE_3_29
Ro(sad) - I'm sorry, it's my fault... & EV_ROSE_3_30
Ar - Hmm... & EV_ROSE_3_31
Ar - Are you ready to take some responsibility then? & EV_ROSE_3_32
Ro - Yes? & EV_ROSE_3_33
Ar - Come with me. & EV_ROSE_3_34
