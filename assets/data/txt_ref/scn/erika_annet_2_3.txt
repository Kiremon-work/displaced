Ar - Hey Rose, what happened to Erika? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_0
Ro(talk) - She said she was going to the city market yesterday & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_1
Ro - She hasn't returned since then. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_2
Ar - Hmm... That seems a bit unlike her.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_3
Ro - Would you like to investigate? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_4
Ar(neutral) - Yeah, I've been bored from sitting around here all day. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_5
Ar - I hope she hasn't decided to live in a big city instead. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_6

Str - The elven girl in skimpy clothes? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_7
Str - Yeah, she was here yesterday.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_8
Str - Was causing some ruckus, then walked away with Annet. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_9
Ro(talk) - Annet? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_10
Str - Yeah, the city committee member, the one with horns. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_11
Ar(neutral) - Oh, right, that one. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_12
Ar - What she's even about? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_13
Str - Don't know much, really.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_14
Str - She was elected due to her business influence and money mostly. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_15
Str - I think she's from an aristocratic family, or that's what she looks like anyway.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_16
Ar(neutral) - Don't you find her weird though?  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_17
Ar - Those horns and tail I mean. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_18
Ar - She kinda looks like a succubus to me. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_19
Str - Hey man, not cool. We arenâ€™t prejudiced. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_20
Str - Anyone can be a good person. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_21
Str - Especially when they have lots of money. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_22
Ar(neutral) - Uh huh, I guess we should check her estate then.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_23
Str - Yeah... Don't tell her I told you though. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_24
Str - And don't comment on those things.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_25
Str - She does not seem to like it. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_26
Ar - ...Right & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_27

Ar - ...So we have been looking for her. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_29
An - I see. Mr. Arron, right? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_30
An - I do indeed know about Erika and where she is right now. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_31
An - But there might be some difficulties. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_32
Ar(neutral) - Such as? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_33
An - You see, she's an old friend of mine and we have just reunited. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_34
An - She wants to stay with me. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_35
Ro - Does she really? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_36
An - Of course she does, silly. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_37
An - You don't believe me? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_38
An - That's fine. Erika, please come in. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_39

Ro - *Huh, she looks quite disturbed* & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_40
Ar - Hey, we were worried. How are you doing? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_41
Er(sad) - I'm sorry for my disappearance, Arron, Rose. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_42
Er(sad) - I will be staying with M- & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_43
Er(sad) - With Annet from now. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_44
Er(sad) - You don't have to stay here. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_45
Ro(shock) - Huh? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_46
=SPRITE annet=
An - As you see, she's perfectly fine and stays here by her will. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_47
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, this does look a bit fishy. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_48
Ro - ..... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_49
An - You are a clever man, Mr. Arron.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_50
An - You do look different from most people in this city.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_51
An - I can tell you aren't of lowly heritage. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_52
Ar(neutral) - Please, you are making me blush. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_53
An - I'm not flattering you.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_54
An - I can see how others react to you, especially your companions.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_55
An - Rose, correct?  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_56
Ro - ... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_57
An - You see, to me there are two kinds of people in this world. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_58
An - Those who rule and those who obey.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_59
An - Erika is obeying me, just as Rose obeys you. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_60
An - That makes us alike, don't you think?  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_61
Ro(talk) - This is absurd. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_62
Ar - Shush, don't make me bring your gag with us next time. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_63
Ro(shock) - !..... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_64
An - Ha, see! You get it. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_65
An - You have come to me so you do hold interest in Erika.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_66
An - Since she has joined you before, you must be a responsible leader. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_67
An - So I'm not wholly against letting her go. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_68
An - But I do need someone around to help me with my... business. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_69
An - Your girl, Rose, looks quite capable of that.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_70
An - What would you say if we switch for an uncertain period of time? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_71
Ro(shock) - ..... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_72
Rose noticed how Erika's eyes screamed protest, but they both remained silent. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_73
She was terrified by the idea of being left alone with Annet. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_74
Ar(neutral) - This is a tempting offer... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_75
Ar - But I'll have to consider it first. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_76
Ar - If that's fine with you. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_77
Ro(talk) - (C-consider?) & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_78
An - Of course not.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_79
An - Once you decide, I'll be waiting.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_80
An - I hope we can have a productive relationship in future. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_81
Ar(neutral) - Likewise. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_3_82
