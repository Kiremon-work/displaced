Ro - There's a new visitor who wants to meet you. Her name is Ember. & EV_EMBER_1_1_0

Em - Hey! & EV_EMBER_1_1_4
Em - You are the mayor, right?! & EV_EMBER_1_1_5
Em - My name is Ember. & EV_EMBER_1_1_6
Ar - Shit, Rose, there's a dragon on the loose! & EV_EMBER_1_1_7
Ro(sarcastic) - Uhm... this is the visitor.  & EV_EMBER_1_1_8
Ar - Huh... well, at least youâ€™re not a goblin. & EV_EMBER_1_1_9
Ar - (She's certainly the hottest dragon I've ever seen. Although, for others, it was generally their biology. ) & EV_EMBER_1_1_10
Ember seemingly pays no attention to the commentary. & EV_EMBER_1_1_11
Em - I'm sorry, am I being too blunt again? Ah-ha, Sorry... & EV_EMBER_1_1_12
Em - Wow, this place is really great! And you look very representative as well! & EV_EMBER_1_1_13
Ar - It is, indeed. My skills were recognized by the folk so I was found to be the most suitable ruler. & EV_EMBER_1_1_14
Ro(sarcastic) - Indeed, given you were the only candidate. & EV_EMBER_1_1_15
Ar - I'll have to penalize you for spilling my trade secrets. & EV_EMBER_1_1_16
Ar - Anyway, what brought you here?  & EV_EMBER_1_1_17
Em - Ah, You see, I'm a blacksmith's... & EV_EMBER_1_1_18
Em - ...apprentice. & EV_EMBER_1_1_19
Em - It might not sound great, but I was one for a really long time! & EV_EMBER_1_1_20
Em - Since this town has a ruler now, you do need a blacksmith, right? & EV_EMBER_1_1_21
Em - Someone to take care of tools, weapons and armor. Please, let me start a forge here! & EV_EMBER_1_1_22
Em - I'm a bit short on money as of now, but... & EV_EMBER_1_1_23
Em - If you allow me to open my personal shop, I will craft whatever you need as a payment. That's a great deal, right?  & EV_EMBER_1_1_24
Ro(sarcastic) - Does anyone even need a smith shop around here..? & EV_EMBER_1_1_25
Ar - A valid point, why here of all places? & EV_EMBER_1_1_26
Em - I'll tell you, but it's a secret, so don't tell anyone, alright?  & EV_EMBER_1_1_27
Ar - Sure, I'll just force Rose to wear a gag whenever she goes out, to make sure she stays quiet. So? & EV_EMBER_1_1_28
Ro(sarcastic) - *Frown* & EV_EMBER_1_1_29
Em - Have you seen the competition? & EV_EMBER_1_1_30
Em - Do you realize how much profit I'll be making with no other blacksmiths around? This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop! & EV_EMBER_1_1_31
Em - I might not look like it, but I have studied my craft. & EV_EMBER_1_1_32
Em - This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop! & EV_EMBER_1_1_33

Ember's eyes began filling with tears. & EV_EMBER_1_1_39

Ar - We can't be driven by woman's emotions in hefty decisions. & EV_EMBER_1_1_44
Ro - Hmph, I'm leaving then. & EV_EMBER_1_1_45
Ar - You can't leave. You were mine to start with! & EV_EMBER_1_1_46
Ro - That was in Avior, here I'm free to do what I want.  & EV_EMBER_1_1_47
Ro - Now, let's go Ember, I'm sure we will find a more friendly place than this. & EV_EMBER_1_1_48

Em(happy) - Wow, thank you, Arron! I'm so indebted to you for this. & EV_EMBER_1_1_58
Ro(sarcastic) - (What a coincidental use of words.) & EV_EMBER_1_1_59
Em - You won't regret it! & EV_EMBER_1_1_60
Ar - So, you gonna need a house for a forge? We might be able to assemble something... & EV_EMBER_1_1_61
Em - Oh, there's no need. I brought my house with me! It's on the hill right outside of town. & EV_EMBER_1_1_62
Ro(talk) - Huh, really. Did you carry it all by yourself? Half-dragons can do stuff like that?  & EV_EMBER_1_1_63
Em - Ha-ha, I've always been carrying stuff around the forge, so I wouldn't get in the way of Master's work.  & EV_EMBER_1_1_64
Ar - Well, that's all the better for us, but I'll have to tax you for taking town's space.  & EV_EMBER_1_1_65
Em - Okay! & EV_EMBER_1_1_66
Ember has joined the settlement. Forge is available now. & EV_EMBER_1_1_67
