Ro - Okay, we've searched through the central library.  & EV_AEROS_3_0
Ar(neutral) - So what have you found? & EV_AEROS_3_1
Ro - We've gone through Rilu's description and only found scarce mentions of someone matching it.  & EV_AEROS_3_2
Ro - The person is referred to as the Traveler. They are thought to be some sort of powerful mage or maybe not even a human. & EV_AEROS_3_3
Ar - Interesting. So you say there's a chance that Traveler is a cute girl?  & EV_AEROS_3_4
Ro(sarcastic) - Sure, if that makes you motivated.  & EV_AEROS_3_5
Ro - Problem is we don't really have any leads. There's one book with a detailed description, though. & EV_AEROS_3_6
Ro - An artifact named "Saintâ€™s Pearl". It's rumored to have great power and is associated with the Traveler.  & EV_AEROS_3_7
Ro - Perhaps we should investigate it. & EV_AEROS_3_8
Er - Oh, I know where we can find it.  & EV_AEROS_3_9
Ro(shock) - You do?! Where is it? & EV_AEROS_3_10
Er - Hmmm... But what would I get from telling you? & EV_AEROS_3_11
Ro - *Sigh* What do you want? & EV_AEROS_3_12
Er - A night together? & EV_AEROS_3_13
Ro - No. & EV_AEROS_3_14
Er - A kiss? & EV_AEROS_3_15
Ro - No.  & EV_AEROS_3_16
Er - Can I touch your fluffy tail at least, then?  & EV_AEROS_3_17
Ro(sarcastic) - (I'm not getting out of this one, am I?) & EV_AEROS_3_18
Ro(talk) - Fine, just do it and tell us already. & EV_AEROS_3_19
Er - He-he, sure.  & EV_AEROS_3_20
Er - Don't worry, I'll be gentle... & EV_AEROS_3_21
=SHAKE_SPRITE 0.3=
Ro(shock) - ... Ah! & EV_AEROS_3_22
Er - Oh, sorry, I didn't expect you to be this sensitive. & EV_AEROS_3_23
Er - Mhmm it's really soft and nice to touch. & EV_AEROS_3_24
Ro(talk) - Enough, just tell us.  & EV_AEROS_3_25
Er - Okay... the Faery Queen has it in her possessions. & EV_AEROS_3_26
Ar - Faeries? Do you mean those small things in the forest? & EV_AEROS_3_27
Er - Yep. They are nasty little bastards. & EV_AEROS_3_28
Er - I'll enjoy tearing a few of their wings on the way there. & EV_AEROS_3_29
Ro - That seems a bit harsh for you. & EV_AEROS_3_30
Er - They trick or even attack people on sight so they earn it. And they grow back with time anyway. & EV_AEROS_3_31
Ar - You know how we can find her? & EV_AEROS_3_32
Er - Sure, but catching her might prove to be a hard task. & EV_AEROS_3_33
Ar(neutral) - We'll figure something out once we get there. & EV_AEROS_3_34
