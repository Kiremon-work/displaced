The team barges into the main room with Dimitrius in it. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_0
=SOUND doorsmash=
De - Hm? Oh, I almost forgot about you, fools. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_1
Er(anger) - Stop screwing around. Give our friends back! & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_2
De - How about "No"? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_3
Ar(neutral) - Figured asking nicely wouldn't work with you.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_4
Ar - Would you consider trading with us then? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_5
De - Hah, what can you possibly offer to me? Your lives? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_6
Ar - How about this?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_7
Arron presents the previously acquired black ring. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_8
De - An interesting thing, but what good does it do to you?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_9
De - You would never dare to use it anyway.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_10
Ri - You are right, Arron wouldn't.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_11
Ri - But I will. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_12
D(anger) - Hmph, is that so? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_13
Ar(neutral) - Since you know about it, you know about her goal. If you don't want your existence completely erased, return our friends. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_14
De - Hahahah, good. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_15
De - Rose, come over here. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_16
=SPRITE rose=
Ro(shock) - Master, what are you doing here!? I've told you to leave me! & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_17
Ar(neutral) - So, you want me to leave? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_18
Ro - ..... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_19
Ar(neutral) - I'm taking you back with us. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_19_1
Ro(sad) - Why are you so stupid. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_20
Ro(sad) - After all those terrible things I've said... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_21
Ar(neutral) - I can't remember a thing. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_22
Em - We still think of you as friend, Rose. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_23
Er - And more. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_24
Ro(sad) - ...I'm sorry... I don't deserve this. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_25
Ar(neutral) - Oh, enough of your whining already. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_26
Rose hesitatingly makes a step towards the group. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_27
De - Aahahah, really nice one Arron. I'm quite impressed. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_28
De - Fine, you can have your girls.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_29
Ro(shock) - But you've said to me... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_30
De - Too bad, darling, Arron wins this round. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_31
De - I can't allow them to destroy my reign. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_32
Iola also appears by Arron's side. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_33
De - *snap*  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_34
I - Uh... Oh... Where am I? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_35
Ro - ... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_36
De - Here, they aren't under my influence anymore.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_37
De - Now give that to me. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_38
Rilu silently threw the ring in Dimitrius' direction. It vanished in a thin air. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_39
De - Good, you made me worry for a moment there.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_40
De - That's quite an achievement for you, pests.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_41
Er - You act all high and mighty, but we have an upper hand now. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_42
Er - Your plan failed. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_43
De - What?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_44
De - Aahahah, holy shit, you thought my plan was to steal your friends? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_45
De - You truly are an idiot. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_46
De - You only interested me because of your connection to the other dimension, and now I've achieved it anyway. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_47
Ro - W-what!? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_48
De - Yeah, I never really cared if you join me or not, Rose, but it's always entertaining to make mortals hate each other. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_49
De - This was fun while it lasted, but it's time to finish with this world already. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_50
De - And once we are done here, it's your home's turn. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_51

The ground began to shake as the magic aura surrounded Dimitrius. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_52
Ar(shock) - Eh? What's going on? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_52
Ri(talk) - This is bad, we should stop him. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_53
Ar(anger) - Shit, no other choice!.. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_54
De - Don't make me laugh you wimp. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_55
Unexpectedly to everyone, Dimitrius pulled an unknown metal object from his back. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_2_56
