A horde of large demons swarmed the hall from all directions. & EV_ANNET_2_2
Ar(shock) - Oh shit! & EV_ANNET_2_3
Ar(shock) - Stay together. & EV_ANNET_2_4
Ro(shock) - There's too many! & EV_ANNET_2_5

An - Ha-h, lets see how long you'll hold up. & EV_ANNET_2_8
An - But while we are at it... & EV_ANNET_2_9
I(sad) - This looks really bad, there's no end to them. & EV_ANNET_2_10

Ar(shock) - What are you doing?! & EV_ANNET_2_15
Er(sad) - I'm... sorry. & EV_ANNET_2_16
Ignoring the battle and enemies, Erika left the team and slowly walked into Annet's direction. & EV_ANNET_2_17
Ro(shock) - No way... & EV_ANNET_2_18
An - Hahah, you imbeciles! & EV_ANNET_2_19
An - Did you seriously think I'd leave my toy with no security measures? & EV_ANNET_2_20
Ro - You are the lowest. & EV_ANNET_2_21
Ro(talk) - Stop, Erika! & EV_ANNET_2_22
An - Don't waste your breath. & EV_ANNET_2_23
An - She was hypnotized long time ago to obey my will on command.  & EV_ANNET_2_24

An - Your really don't know how to secure victory, Arron. & EV_ANNET_2_26

Whole room froze in awe as Erika stabbed Annet's neck. & EV_ANNET_2_29
An(anger) - Wha...t... & EV_ANNET_2_30
An(anger) - Why... & EV_ANNET_2_31
Er(anger) - You are right. & EV_ANNET_2_32
Er(anger) - Never leave things to chance. & EV_ANNET_2_33

With Annet's defeat all demons in the hall quickly retreated from sight. & EV_ANNET_2_42

Er(sad) - I'm shaking now. & EV_ANNET_2_44
Er - But somehow feel great. & EV_ANNET_2_45
Ar - Yeah, you've saved us. & EV_ANNET_2_46
Er - Turns out, I'm a pretty good actress, huh? & EV_ANNET_2_47
Ro - You really made us worried.  & EV_ANNET_2_48
Er - I've realized she'd always treat me as her victim. & EV_ANNET_2_49
Er - So I thought this would be a safer approach. & EV_ANNET_2_50

Ar(anger) - Dimitrius! & EV_ANNET_2_53
De - Now, don't look so mad. & EV_ANNET_2_54
De - You've done me a great service today and I'll spare your lives for some time. & EV_ANNET_2_55
Ar(neutral) - You might end up dead by the end of it as well. & EV_ANNET_2_56
De - Ahahah, nice one, Arron.  & EV_ANNET_2_57
De - You just have no idea how troublesome it is to kill another demon lord with a big reputation in this world.  & EV_ANNET_2_58
De - But you actually did it. & EV_ANNET_2_59
Ro - You wanted her dead? That's why you didn't help her? & EV_ANNET_2_60
De - That's what I said.  & EV_ANNET_2_61
De - I thought about giving you a hand on one occasion, but you managed anyway. & EV_ANNET_2_62
Ri - You've left your kin here to die like that. & EV_ANNET_2_63
Ro - They don't think of their own any higher than of normal people. & EV_ANNET_2_64
Em(sad) - You really aren't afraid to lose? & EV_ANNET_2_65
De - What, do you really  think I should be worried about you? & EV_ANNET_2_66
De - You just don't understand, do you? & EV_ANNET_2_67
De - You are not a threat. You killed Annet, but she was weak and stupid.  & EV_ANNET_2_68
De - I can squash you all like bugs, but you never know when you might need a couple of resourceful mortals. & EV_ANNET_2_69
I - We'll stop you and end this madness. & EV_ANNET_2_70
De - Yeah, sure, struggle some more if you wish. & EV_ANNET_2_71

Ar(neutral) - Let's return to the village.  & EV_ANNET_2_79
Ro - Indeed, this was a tough day. & EV_ANNET_2_80
Surv - But what should we do? What if demons return? & EV_ANNET_2_81
Ar(neutral) - I'm afraid my charisma is too low to take you all. & EV_ANNET_2_82
Ar - You will have to figure out how to defend yourself eventually. & EV_ANNET_2_83
The team left puzzled civilians. & EV_ANNET_2_84
I(sad) - I wonder if we should've left them like this. & EV_ANNET_2_85
Ar(neutral) - It can't be helped. & EV_ANNET_2_86
Er(sad) - After seeing what was happening in the city I don't feel like we should've helped them even if we could. & EV_ANNET_2_87
